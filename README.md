# Customer Clustering for Discount Coupon Distribution Project

This project aims to cluster customers into different groups to enable the company to treat them according to their specific profiles. This will allow for the customization of marketing strategies, such as targeted discount coupon distribution, to increase customer satisfaction and optimize sales.

## About the Project

The dataset used contains information such as invoice number, product code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country. Through these characteristics, we aim to cluster customers based on their purchasing behaviors, identifying distinct profiles that can be targeted with personalized promotional campaigns.

## Insights Obtained

During the exploratory data analysis (EDA), we obtained several valuable insights:

1. **Gross Revenue:** We calculated the gross revenue generated by each customer by multiplying the quantity of products purchased by the unit price.

2. **Recency Days:** We determined the recency of purchases, i.e., the number of days since the last purchase made by each customer.

3. **Quantity of Products:** We evaluated the total quantity of products purchased by each customer over the analyzed period.

4. **Purchase Frequency:** We measured the frequency of purchases by calculating the average number of days between purchases made by each customer.

5. **Returns:** We analyzed product returns, considering the total quantity of items returned by each customer.

## Code Structure

### 1. Imports

We imported the necessary libraries for data analysis and manipulation, as well as for visualization and modeling.

### 2. Dataset Loading

We loaded the dataset and performed initial cleaning, removing unnecessary columns.

### 3. Data Description

We renamed the columns for easier interpretation and checked dimensions, data types, and missing values.

### 4. Variable Filtering

We applied filters to remove irrelevant or inconsistent records and variables, ensuring data quality.

### 5. Feature Engineering

We created new features from existing data to enrich the analysis:

- **Gross Revenue:** We calculated revenue generated by each customer.
- **Recency Days:** We determined the recency of purchases.
- **Quantity of Products:** We counted the quantity of products purchased.
- **Purchase Frequency:** We measured the frequency of purchases.
- **Returns:** We analyzed product returns.

### 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to better understand the distribution and correlation of variables. We also explored the spatial distribution of the data.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning

We used clustering techniques (K-Means and GMM) to segment customers and adjusted hyperparameters to achieve better results.

### 8. Model Training

We trained machine learning models to cluster customers based on the created features.

### 9. Cluster Analysis

We analyzed the resulting clusters to identify customer profiles and behavior patterns, using visual inspection and descriptive statistics.

## Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for customer segmentation, enabling the identification of distinct profiles and customization of marketing strategies. With the insights obtained, the company can send targeted discount coupons, increasing customer satisfaction and optimizing sales.
